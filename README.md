# face-generation
This is the fourth project of Deep Learning nanodegree program at [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101). 

In this project, you'll define and train a DCGAN on a dataset of faces.The goal is to get a generator network to generate new images of faces that look as realistic as possible!

At the end of the notebook, you'll be able to visualize the results of your trained Generator to see how it performs; your generated samples should look like fairly realistic faces with small amounts of noise.

# Setup
Clone the repo:

`git clone https://github.com/Melmarn/face-generation.git`

Install PyTorch, torchvision and a few required pip packages, see in notebook.
